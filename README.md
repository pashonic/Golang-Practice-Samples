# Golang-Practice-Samples

This repo are sets of Golang projects I written to learn Golang and track my progress. For each project I provide details on specific aspects of Golang I am attemping to understand.

Goal is to keep each project as simple as possible and use good coding practices such as designing the projects in such a way so that they are easily understood with limit comments and unit tested.
