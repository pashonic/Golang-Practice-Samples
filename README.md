# Golang-Practice-Samples

This repo contains Golang projects I written to learn Golang and track my progress. For each project I provide details on specific aspects of Golang I am attemping to understand. Projects you written yourself are also good references when you forget things.

Goal is to keep each project as simple as possible and use good coding practices.

## Sample Projects

### [Number Guess Game Version 1](Number-Guess/Version1)

* Basic control flow
* Prompting user input from command line
* Generating random numbers
* Basic pointer concepts

### [Number Guess Game Version 2](Number-Guess/Version2)

* Using packages, or referencing local external code
* Structs
* Functions
* Function methods
* switch control flow
* Pointer concepts
* Making enum like object using const
* Isolating object components/members (private/public concepts)
* Unit tests

### [Cribbage Stat](Cribbage-Stat)

* Complex algorithmic functions with focus on complexity (BIG O notation)
* Channels with Go routines (multi-threading)
* Performance unit tests
* Recursion
* Using [Make](https://pkg.go.dev/builtin#make) to create strutures on the heap
* Function references (or function pointers)
* Using numbers instead of strings to track data structures to improve performance
